                <p>Vocal coach, studio owner and tech entrepreneur Emma Mendez is a woman who talks about her work, 
                    dreams and her passions stemming from her neighbourhood.
                    Emma Mendez is an entrepreneur for social change in the music and tech industry, 
                    recognising that there needs to be employment opportunities for people in the arts, 
                    reducing suppression leading to crime and unemployment.</p>   
                    <p>Born in UK to Caribbean parents (Barbados, Jamaica), 
                    Emma sees Birmingham (#0121) as a city of diverse cultures, and a beautiful melting pot of creatives. 
                    Her area of expertise is vocal training / coaching, motivational speaking, employment advice and business start up consulting.</p>
                    
                    <p>Emma is the owner of the Anyone Can Sing Vocal Academy, also recently becoming the CEO at ARAIVR Systems Ltd, an AI focused software and hardware development collective,
                        and the co-owner of Dime Studios C.I.C, 
                        a multi use creative hub for young people and adults in the community.   
                        With many youth clubs and community centres slowly being closed down, Dime Studios is a epicentre
                        studio for incubating choreographers, photographers, engineers and pioneers starting at just Â£6ph to incubate 
                        and to help local creatives nurture their talent. In a time of closures and rising prices, 
                        the co-owned core C.I.C sustains incubation prices for the creative economy.
