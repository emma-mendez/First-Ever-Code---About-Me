            <q>What inspires me? Birmingham. We are creative. I'm talking about me and my girls or the mandem, we just link up, put a beat on and cipher. 
                The suppression of Birmingham's creatives inspired me to create something without the red tape.<q>

            <q>When you develop and cultivate relationships at the beginning you don't know who people will go on to be. 
                We grow into being at the epicentre of what's going on, working with minds. It's such a journey, 
                and we become significant in each others lives.<q>

            <q>I was inspired by the solutions that I felt Birmingham needed for creatives because economically, without understanding why, I knew there was a problem.
                I was creating a plug for employment because I could see the same cycle of jail-jobcentre talent.<q>

            <q>I've learnt that when you are given a 'no', query it, using your own personality, 
                because things might be cold on paper, but I'm for real. 
                And once I meet people at that level it always seems to work out. 
                I'm gonna go hard at the thing I said I want.<q>

                Emma: "That's very important, because it's yin & yang. 
                It's important to know when you're demotivated, so you can mosaic the pieces back together.<q>

            <q>I'm nobody right now, but I'm somebody and so I behave into that. 
                My vision is to be a matriarch, a pillar in the community. 
                That's why I've had the staying power. All the things that were impacting me I needed solutions for.<q>
